# kmeth
A hidden forge based Minecraft cheat.

Notes
-----
* This project was made for fun and is over five months old. Very little of the code was pasted, but most of my code is very sloppy and horribly done and should not be pasted.
* All detection method fixes have been removed from the code, I'm not going to spoon feed you that much.
* Everything that has to do with rendering (utilities, click gui, etc.) was created by Dustin and Lemon as I'm horrible at the rendering side of things.
* This project was named after github@devtoaster's CS:GO cheat "kryst4lmeth" as a joke between a friend and I.
* Made using Minecraft Forge 1.7.10-1558. Download: http://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.7.10-10.13.4.1558-1.7.10/forge-1.7.10-10.13.4.1558-1.7.10-src.zip
